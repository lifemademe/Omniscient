description: Guidance for writing multiplayer game code in Genesys. Use when implementing networked features, RPCs, replicated nodes (SceneNode/PrimitiveNode roots, ReplicationGroup) or properties, server-authoritative logic, game mode lifecycle, player spawning in multiplayer, or when the user mentions multiplayer, networking, server, client, replication, RPC, latency, or authority. Also use when rendering playerName, team, chat, scoreboards, lobbies, or other replicated strings in the HUD (safe UI / XSS).

# Methodology

Follow these steps when working on multiplayer features:

1. Determine where the code must run — server, client, or both — before writing anything. Consult [server-authority](references/server-authority.md) to understand NetRuntime and NetRole.
2. Decide whether the feature needs an RPC, a replicated property, or both. Consult [rpcs](references/rpcs.md) and [node-replication](references/node-replication.md).
3. If the feature is part of match rules or player lifecycle, read [game-mode](references/game-mode.md).
4. If the feature involves a player-controlled node (Pawn/PlayerController), read [player-ownership](references/player-ownership.md).
5. Guard all authority-only logic with `this.hasAuthority()` or `NetRuntime.isServer()`.
6. If the feature displays replicated or join strings in the UI (names, teams, chat, scoreboards), read [ui-security](references/ui-security.md) and follow **Safe UI for replicated strings** below.

# Core Multiplayer Guidelines

- Import the engine module with `import * as ENGINE from '@gnsx/genesys.js'`.
- Import `NetRuntime` from `@gnsx/genesys.js` for runtime environment checks.
- The server is the only machine that changes game state. Clients send requests (via `@ServerRPC`) and display the result.
- Guard all state-modifying logic with `this.hasAuthority()` on the replicated node or `NetRuntime.isServer()` for non-node code.
- Do not read `NetRuntime` in constructors. The runtime type is set before `beginPlay` is called; guard in `beginPlay` or later.
- `this.replicated = true` only marks a node as *eligible* for a nearby `ReplicationGroup` — it does **not** create the group. A `ReplicationGroup` must exist on the networked subtree root or nothing replicates. Deprecated `Actor` auto-creates the group via its `replicated` setter; `Pawn` / `PlayerController` call `ensureReplicationGroup` in `initialize`. Custom `SceneNode`/`PrimitiveNode` roots must call `ENGINE.ensureReplicationGroup(this)` themselves (typically in `initialize`, with `isRoot = true`). Setting `replicated` on a client has no effect; do not set it after the node is already in the world. Details: [node-replication](references/node-replication.md).
- Mark properties for network sync with `@ENGINE.property({ replicate: true })`. Only nodes inside a `ReplicationGroup` synchronise their replicated properties.
- Use `@ServerRPC` when a client needs the server to perform an action (e.g., fire a weapon, request a respawn).
- Use `@ClientRPC` when the server needs to notify the owning client of something (e.g., display a UI prompt).
- Use `@MulticastRPC` for events that every client must see simultaneously (e.g., an explosion visual).
- GameMode methods only execute on the server. Do not call them from client-side code.
- All nodes are server-authoritative, including PlayerController and its Pawn. The controlling client has the AutonomousProxy role for its own controller and pawn, which allows local movement prediction. The server validates those actions and replicates the authoritative result back; the client corrects if there is a discrepancy.

# Safe UI for replicated strings (mandatory)

Replicated strings and `joinParams` are **untrusted for HTML**. The engine does
not sanitize them. Render as text; never as markup.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| `playerName` / chat / team → `textContent`, `setLabel`, `setMessage`, `setTitle` | `` innerHTML = `<span>${playerName}</span>` `` |
| Icons → `ENGINE.Icons.*` or static SVG you author | Pass network strings to `iconHtml`, `setHTML`, `imageHtml` |
| Optional: validate display names in `GameMode` from `joinParams` | Rely on server name checks alone instead of safe rendering |

```ts
// ✅
row.appendChild(document.createElement('span')).textContent = playerInfo.playerName;
chat.setMessage({ name: playerName, body: messageText });

// ❌
el.innerHTML = `<span>${playerInfo.playerName}</span>`;
uiElement.setHTML(`<b>${playerName}</b>`);
```

# Tips

- When in doubt about where code runs, add a temporary `console.log(NetRuntime.getType())` to verify.
- Replicated property updates flow from server to clients only. A client writing to a replicated property has no network effect.
- `@ServerRPC` methods execute directly when called with authority on the server. Wrap the call site in `if (NetRuntime.isClient())` if the server shouldn't trigger the method.
- Consult the engine source under `.engine/` for exact method signatures before writing RPC or replication code.
